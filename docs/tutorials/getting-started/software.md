# Software Tools & Installation

__Do not use NuGet, compatibility issues will arise and MRTK does not support it!__

### Software

##### Basics:

- Windows 10 Pro
- Visual Studio 2019
- Unity Hub

##### Unity 2019.3f...:

Unity Hub manages this and can support multiple installed versions.

##### MRTK v2.4.x

Download the libs for now, we will add them to a project later.

Get the 4 `.unitypackage` files from the MRTK releases: https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.4.0

### Extras

These are nice to have around

- VS Code
- WSL
- OBS Studio
- Some 3D model studio?
