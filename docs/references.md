### Unity / MRTK extras

Unity + NuGet:

- `Fluxor` (Flux/Redux) https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor
- `Newtonsoft.Json` (JSON handling) https://www.newtonsoft.ocm/json
- `TotalJSON` Easily work with JSON: http://www.leguar.com/unity/totaljson/ (This one might be easier work with arbitrary data, but less supported)

External:

- Better physics engine for XR: https://www.havok.com/products/havok-physics/ (this might be merging into microsoft)
- ^^^ Can download in Unity Store for $20, but again, keep an eye on the experimental engine in MRTK that might be this?)


### Pitfalls and known issues

- Unity remote device borked on HL2: 
- Don't use NuGet with Unity: https://www.damirscorner.com/blog/posts/20150523-UsingNuGetInVisualStudioToolsForUnity.html
