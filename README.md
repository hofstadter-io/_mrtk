# _mrtk

Docs, Tutorials, and Code Samples for the Mixed Reality Toolkit.

These will mainly focus on Unity + MRTK using the HoloLens 2.
If you have another device, these should be easily adaptable.
Unity + MRTK supports almost all products and platforms out there
including: Win, iOS, Android, and most VR systems.
We will also add further docs as we develop these ourselves.
If you have your own to add, we are more than happy to get a PR!

There will also be a underlying theme of "Using MRTK for Business"
and a traditional programmers perspective rather than game development.
Expect to see API servers and databases rather than game engines!

One more note, the Unity UI directions (to panels and tabs) assumes the default layout.
